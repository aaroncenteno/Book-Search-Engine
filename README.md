# Book Search Engine

## Description

This weeks challenge was to take a application that used express API routes and refactor it to use an Apollo Server and GraphQL queries and mutations. This application allows a user to search google books via google's API and then view that books information. If the user decides to sign-up then they can save their searched books to their account and view their saved books as well. On the '/saved' page users can see their saved books and choose to remove them if they would like.
